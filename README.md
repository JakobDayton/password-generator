# Password Generator

## Description

To create a strong, secure password, I've used javascript to help create a randomly generated string of numbers, upper and
lowercase letters, and/or special characters depending on what the user choses to include in the password.

## Usage

Fill out the prompts to give the password generator criteria pertaining to what types of characters you want to use for your password
as well as the length of the pasword.
